# Starting Your Penetration Testing Journey

Penetration testing is an exciting and rewarding field, but getting started can be overwhelming. Here's a roadmap based on my own experience.

## 1. Build a Strong Foundation

### Networking Fundamentals
Understanding how networks work is crucial:
- TCP/IP protocols
- OSI model
- Subnetting and routing
- DNS and DHCP

### Operating Systems
Get comfortable with both:
- **Linux**: Command line, file permissions, services
- **Windows**: Active Directory basics, PowerShell, registry

### Programming Basics
You don't need to be a developer, but scripting helps:
- Python (highly recommended)
- Bash scripting
- Basic understanding of web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, SQL)

## 2. Learn the Tools

Start with these essential tools:

### Reconnaissance
- **Nmap**: Network scanning and enumeration
- **Recon-ng**: Web reconnaissance framework
- **theHarvester**: OSINT gathering

### Web Application Testing
- **Burp Suite**: The industry standard for web app pentesting
- **OWASP ZAP**: Free alternative to Burp
- **sqlmap**: Automated SQL injection testing

### Exploitation
- **Metasploit**: Exploitation framework
- **SearchSploit**: Exploit database search

### Post-Exploitation
- **LinPEAS/WinPEAS**: Privilege escalation scripts
- **BloodHound**: Active Directory attack path visualization

## 3. Practice Platforms

### Hack The Box
- Start with retired machines
- Follow writeups initially, then try yourself
- Join the HTB Academy for structured learning

### TryHackMe
- Beginner-friendly rooms
- Structured learning paths
- Interactive labs

### PortSwigger Web Security Academy
- Free web application security training
- Hands-on labs for OWASP Top 10
- Excellent for learning Burp Suite

### Vulnerable Machines
- **DVWA**: Damn Vulnerable Web Application
- **VulnHub**: Various vulnerable VMs
- **PentesterLab**: Web app pentesting exercises

## 4. Get Certified

Certifications validate your skills:

### Entry Level
- **CEH**: Certified Ethical Hacker
- **eJPT**: eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester

### Intermediate
- **PNPT**: Practical Network Penetration Tester
- **OSCP**: Offensive Security Certified Professional
- **CPTS**: HTB Certified Penetration Tester

### Advanced
- **OSEP**: Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester
- **OSWE**: Offensive Security Web Expert

## 5. Build a Portfolio

### GitHub
- Share scripts and tools you've created
- Document your learning journey
- Contribute to open-source security tools

### Blog/Writeups
- Document your HTB/TryHackMe solutions
- Write about vulnerabilities you've found
- Share your methodology and thought process

### Bug Bounty
- Start with responsible disclosure programs
- Document your findings
- Build a reputation through legitimate bug hunting

## 6. Network and Learn

- Join security communities (Discord, Reddit, Twitter)
- Attend local cybersecurity meetups
- Follow security researchers and pentesters
- Participate in CTF competitions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rushing**: Take time to understand concepts deeply
2. **Skipping basics**: Fundamentals matter more than you think
3. **Only using tools**: Understand what tools do under the hood
4. **Not documenting**: Keep notes of everything you learn
5. **Giving up**: Pentesting is challenging, persistence is key

## Final Thoughts

Penetration testing requires continuous learning. The field evolves rapidly, and staying updated is crucial. Start with the basics, practice consistently, and don't be afraid to ask questions.

Remember: **Ethics first**. Always get proper authorization before testing any system.

Good luck on your journey!
